    Notes-
    What is Stack?
    ==> Stack is a Linear Data Structure.
    --> Works on the basis of LIFO(Last In First Out).

    Stack Overflow -> When no more space is present in the stack and still data is inserted in it.

    Applications of Stack ==>
    1. Used in function calls
    2. Infix to PostFix 
    3. Parenthesis Matching and more

    STACK ADT
    => We need a pointer at the topmost element of the stack
    Some operations are as below :-
    1.push() => push an element
    2.pop() => remove topmost element from the stack
    3.peek(index) => Value at a given position is given
    4.isEmpty() => check whether stack is empty or not
    5.isFull(); => check whether stack is empty or not

    Implementation ==>
    Stack can be implemented using Array or Linked List.
