Lecture 13 Introduction to Linked List 

Linked List - Elements are stored in non-contiguous memory location.
            - Contains a data and a pointer attributes which is termed as node.
            - Elements can easily be added and removed in case of Linked List.

First Node = Head
Last Node points to NULL --> In Singly LinkedList
Last Node points to Head --> In Singly Circular LinkedList
Last Node = Tail

Time Complexity - O(n)

** Drawbacks of Linked List 
1. Extra memory space for pointer is required(for evry node 1 pointer is needed.)
2. Random access is not allowed as elements are stored in non-contiguous memory locations.
